### Purpose

Synthetic biology builds upon the techniques and successes of genetics, molecular biology, and metabolic engineering by applying engineering principles to the design of biological systems. These principles include standardization, modularity, and design abstraction. The field still faces substantial challenges, including long development times, high rates of failure, and poor reproducibility. A common factor of these challenges is the exchange of information about designed systems between laboratories.

The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information in synthetic biology. For a quick introduction to SBOL, please browse through (IWBDA 2019 SBOL Workshop presentation)[https://github.com/SynBioDex/Community-Media/blob/master/2019/IWBDA19/IWBDA2019.pdf] and (SEED 2018 SBOL presentation)[https://github.com/SynBioDex/Community-Media/blob/master/2018/SEED/Workshop-Introduction.pptx].

### Vision

In order to ground SBOL Visual with precise definitions, we reference its visual elements to data models with a well-defined semantics. SBOL Visual are defined in terms of their relation to the SBOL 2 data model, and terms in the Sequence Ontology, the Systems Biology Ontology, and BioPAX.

### Usage

SBOL Visual acts as a guideline to graphically depict genetic designs and its functional interaction.
A quick introduction can be found [here]({{< relref "visual-glyphs" >}}).  

To get an idea on how these glyphs has been used in software tools, view all of the [SBOL Visual tools]({{< relref "applications" >}}) that have been reported to us.  

Also take a look at sample papers that have been published online for SBOL visual, featuring SBOL visual, and software tools supporting SBOL visual [here]({{< relref "publication" >}}).

### Download Glyphs

We support SBOL Visual glyphs in the following formats: PNG, SVG, and PDF. You can download our copy of the glyphs [here]({{< relref "visual-glyphs" >}}).

If you plan on creating your own glyphs, we recommend following the guidelines in the [SBOL Visual Specification]({{< relref "visual-specification" >}}) to ensure they will work well as part of an SBOL Visual diagram.

### Proposing a New Feature to the SBOL Data Model

To propose a new feature to SBOL visual, a standard procedure must be followed.

1. Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/issues) on the SBOL-visual Github repository.
2. Create a SBOL Enhancement Proposal (SEP)
    * A detailed description about what is an SEP, how to create an SEP, and how to submit an SEP can be found [here](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/issues/1).
    * A template of what a general SEP should look like can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/master/sep_002_template.md).
    * For further assistance, please contact the [SBOL Editors](mailto:sbol-editors@googlegroups.com).
3. The community will discuss on the proposed SEP through the GitHub issue created for the corresponding SEP.
4. When the community has reached a consensus for the proposed SEP, voting will then be initiated to determine if the SEP will get accepted into the new release of SBOL Visual.
