The SBOL-OWL ontology provides a set of controlled terms that are used to describe genetic circuit designs using SBOL. Terms are included for the followings.

* Descriptions of SBOL entities (e.g. “ComponentDefinition“) that are exchanged electronically. Constraints and validation rules that are enforced on SBOL entities are also captured as part of the ontology.
* SBOL entities (e.g. “TopLevel“) that are not serialised but are used to group different SBOL entities. SBOL-OWL exposes these entities to semantic reasoning tools via parent-child relationships.
* Terms (e.g. “inline“) that are used to restrict values of SBOL entities.
* Properties (e.g. “sequence“) linking SBOL entities to accepted values.
* Metadata terms (e.g. “Promoter“) for commonly used descriptions of design entities. Such terms may require the use of several SBOL entities and properties.
