The SBOL-OWL ontology provides a set of controlled terms that are used to describe genetic circuit designs using SBOL. Terms are included for the followings.

* Descriptions of SBOL entities (e.g. [“ComponentDefinition“](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#ComponentDefinition)) that are exchanged electronically. Constraints and validation rules that are enforced on SBOL entities are also captured as part of the ontology.
* SBOL entities (e.g. [“TopLevel“](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#TopLevel)) that are not serialised but are used to group different SBOL entities. SBOL-OWL exposes these entities to semantic reasoning tools via parent-child relationships.
* Terms (e.g. [“inline“](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#inline)) that are used to restrict values of SBOL entities.
* Properties (e.g. [“sequence“](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#sequence)) linking SBOL entities to accepted values.
* Metadata terms (e.g. [“Promoter“](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-owl/sbol-owl.html#Promoter)) for commonly used descriptions of design entities. Such terms may require the use of several SBOL entities and properties.
