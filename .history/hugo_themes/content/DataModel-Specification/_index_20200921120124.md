| **3.x.x Release**  |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| **3.3.0** <br> Condenses and simplifies previous versions of SBOL, separates sequence features from part/sub-part relationships, renames ComponentDefinition/Component to Component/SubComponent, merges Component and Module classes, ensuring consistency between data model and ontology terms, extends the means to define and reference SubComponents, refines requirements on object URIs, enables graph-based serialization, moves Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) for Component types, makes all sequence associations explicit, makes interfaces explicit, generalizes SequenceConstraints into a general structural Constraint class, and expands the set of allowed constraints.| {{% staticref "docs/SBOL-Visual-2.2.pdf" "newtab" %}}Specification{{% /staticref %}}  |   |

| **2.x.x Release** |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| **1.0.0** <br> A set of symbols that can be used to graphically depict functional information encoded by nucleic acid sequences. Each symbol in the set has three components: a shape, a display name, and a definition. | {{% staticref "docs/BBFRFC93.pdf" "newtab" %}}Specification{{% /staticref %}} | [Cite](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002310) |
