___


| **3.x.x Release**  |  |   |
|---|---|---|
| **3.3.0** <br> Condenses and simplifies previous versions of SBOL, separates sequence features from part/sub-part relationships, renames ComponentDefinition/Component to Component/SubComponent, merges Component and Module classes, ensuring consistency between data model and ontology terms, extends the means to define and reference SubComponents, refines requirements on object URIs, enables graph-based serialization, moves Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) for Component types, makes all sequence associations explicit, makes interfaces explicit, generalizes SequenceConstraints into a general structural Constraint class, and expands the set of allowed constraints.| {{% staticref "docs/SBOL-Visual-2.2.pdf" "newtab" %}}Specification{{% /staticref %}}  |   |

| **2.x.x Release** | [Library Implementation]({{< relref "DataModel-Libraries" >}})  |  |
|---|---|---|
| **2.3.0** <br> Includes means of succinctly representing sequence modifications, an extension to support organization and attachment of experimental data, and an extension for describing numerical parameters of design elements. The new version also includes specifying types of synthetic biology activities, unambiguous locations for sequences with multiple encodings, and refinement of a number of validation rules. | {{% staticref "docs/BBFRFC93.pdf" "newtab" %}}Specification{{% /staticref %}} | [Cite](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002310) |
| **2.2.1** <br> A set of symbols that can be used to graphically depict functional information encoded by nucleic acid sequences. Each symbol in the set has three components: a shape, a display name, and a definition. | {{% staticref "docs/BBFRFC93.pdf" "newtab" %}}Specification{{% /staticref %}} | [Cite](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002310) |
