abstract: Modelling and computational simulation are crucial for the large-scale engineering
  of biological circuits since they allow the system under design to be simulated
  prior to implementation in vivo. To support automated, model-driven design it is
  desirable that in silico models are modular, composable and use standard formats.
  The synthetic biology design process typically involves the composition of genetic
  circuits from individual parts. At the most basic level, these parts are representations
  of genetic features such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and coding
  sequences (CDSs). However, it is also desirable to model the biological molecules
  and behaviour that arise when these parts are combined in vivo. Modular models of
  parts can be composed and their associated systems simulated, facilitating the process
  of model-centred design. The availability of databases of modular models is essential
  to support software tools used in the model-driven design process. In this article,
  we present an approach to support the development of composable, modular models
  for synthetic biology, termed Standard Virtual Parts. We then describe a programmatically
  accessible and publicly available database of these models to allow their use by
  computational design tools.
