### Purpose

People who are engineering biological organisms often find it useful to communicate in diagrams, both about the structure of the nucleic acid sequences that they are engineering and about the functional relationships between sequence features and other molecular species. Some typical practices and conventions have begun to emerge for such diagrams. SBOL Visual aims to organize and systematize such conventions in order to produce a coherent language for expressing the structure and function of genetic designs. At the same time, we aim to make this language simple and easy to use, allowing a high degree of flexibility and freedom in how such diagrams are organized, presented, and styledâ€”in particular, it should be readily possible to create diagrams both by hand and with a wide variety of software programs. Finally, means are provided for extending the language with new and custom diagram elements, and for adoption of useful new elements into the language. For a quick introduction to SBOL Visual, please browse through the [IWBDA 2019 SBOL Visual presentation](https://github.com/SynBioDex/Community-Media/blob/master/2019/IWBDA19/SBOL-Visual.pptx).

### Vision

In order to ground SBOL Visual with precise definitions, we reference its visual elements to data models with a well-defined semantics. SBOL Visual are defined in terms of their relation to the SBOL 2 data model, and terms in the Sequence Ontology, the Systems Biology Ontology, and BioPAX.

### Usage

SBOL Visual acts as a guideline to graphically depict genetic designs and its functional interaction.
A quick introduction can be found [here](visual-glyphs).  

To get an idea on how these glyphs has been used in software tools, view all of the SBOL Visual tools that have been reported to us.
