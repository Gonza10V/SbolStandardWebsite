Examples to demonstrate the usage of SBOL Visual glyphs is given below.

Example1: A SBOL visual design of the circuit that contains a promoter, RBS, CDS, and terminator. The promoter is stimulated by CDS that it regulates.

Example2: Phosphorylation of an inactive transcription factor (produced by two different CDSs) by a kinase to form an active transcriptional activator, which then stimulates a promoter.
