### SBOL Visual Ontology

The SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO) provides a set of controlled terms to describe visual glyphs for genetic circuit designs. The terms are organised based on their descriptions in community-edited [Markdown](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/tree/master/Glyphs) files. Terms are defined for recommended and alternative glyphs in addition to terms to represent generic glyphs. SBOL-VO consists of the following items.

* **Terms for glyphs** to represent
    * DNA sequence features (e.g. "[CDSGlyph](http://synbiodex.github.io/SBOL-visual/Ontology/v2/sbol-vo.html#CDSGlyph)", “AptamerGlyph“, “AssemblyScarGlyph” and “AssemblyScarGlyphAlternative” )
    * different types of molecular entities (e.g. ProteinGlyph)
    * binary molecular interactions (e.g. “InhibitionGlyph“)
    * molecular interactions with multiple participants (e.g. “AssociationGlyph“).
* **A base term**. The base term in the ontology is called “Glyph”.
* **Properties**. SBOL-VO includes object properties such as “hasGlyph” and “isAlternativeOf” to define the relationships between different terms.
* **Annotations**. Terms are annotated using properties such as “defaultGlyph” and “recommended”.
* **Ontological axioms**. Logical axioms restricting the use of SBOL-VO terms to specific biological roles and processes.
