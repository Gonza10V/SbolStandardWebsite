|---|---|---|
| **2.2.0**
SBOL Visual 2.2 provides a simple and flexible language for diagrams of genetic systems and design, including both structure (e.g., nucleic acid sequence features) and function (e.g., regulatory interactions and reactions). SBOL Visual 2.2 enhances the prior SBOL Visual 2.1 standard as follows:
* Grounding for molecular species glyphs is changed from BioPAX to SBO (BioPAX terms are retained as deprecated alternatives).
* New glyphs are added for introns and polypeptide regions (e.g., protein domains).
* The macromolecule glyph often confused with yeast is deprecated, and a new glyph for proteins added
* Small polygons are recommended as alternative glyphs for simple chemicals.  | Specification  |   |
