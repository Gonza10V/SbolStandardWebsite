Welcome to the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) standard!

SBOL is a free and open data standard that allows knowledge about biological designs to be captured using a machine-tractable, ontology-backed representation that is built using Semantic Web technologies. The SBOL standard can be used to represent knowledge across multiple scales and throughout the entire synthetic biology workflow, from
the specification of a single molecule or DNA fragment through to multicellular systems containing multiple interacting
genetic circuits.
