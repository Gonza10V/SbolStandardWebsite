abstract: Biological engineers often find it useful to communicate using diagrams.
  These diagrams can include information both about the structure of the nucleic acid
  sequences they are engineering and about the functional relationships between features
  of these sequences and/or other molecular species. A number of conventions and practices
  have begun to emerge within synthetic biology for creating such diagrams, and the
  Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual) has been developed as a standard
  to organize, systematize, and extend such conventions in order to produce a coherent
  visual language. Here, we describe SBOL Visual version 2, which expands previous
  diagram standards to include new functional interactions, categories of molecular
  species, support for families of glyph variants, and the ability to indicate modular
  structure and mappings between elements of a system. SBOL Visual 2 also clarifies
  a number of requirements and best practices, significantly expands the collection
  of glyphs available to describe genetic features, and can be readily applied using
  a wide variety of software tools, both general and bespoke.
