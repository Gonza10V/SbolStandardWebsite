  biology builds upon the techniques and successes of genetics, molecular biology,
  and metabolic engineering by applying engineering principles to the design of biological
  systems. The field still faces substantial challenges, including long development
  times, high rates of failure, and poor reproducibility. One method to ameliorate
  these problems would be to improve the exchange of information about designed systems
  between laboratories. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has been developed
  as a standard to support the specification and exchange of biological design information
  in synthetic biology, filling a need not satisfied by other pre-existing standards.
  This document details version 2.1 of SBOL that builds upon version 2.0 published
  in last year’s JIB special issue. In particular, SBOL 2.1 includes improved rules
  for what constitutes a valid SBOL document, new role fields to simplify the expression
  of sequence features and how components are used in context, and new best practices
  descriptions to improve the exchange of basic sequence topology information and
  the description of genetic design provenance, as well as miscellaneous other minor
  improvements.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectiontextgreater
