abstract: Synthetic biology brings together concepts and techniques from engineering
  and biology. In this field, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary in order to
  bridge the gap between computational modeling and biological data. Using a CAD application,
  it would be possible to construct models using available biological \"parts\" and
  directly generate the DNA sequence that represents the model, thus increasing the
  efficiency of design and construction of synthetic networks.
