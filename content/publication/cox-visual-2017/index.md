abstract: As protein engineering becomes more sophisticated, practitioners increasingly
  need to share diagrams for communicating protein designs. To this end, we present
  a draft visual language, Protein Language, that describes the high-level architecture
  of an engineered protein with easy-to-draw glyphs, intended to be compatible with
  other biological diagram languages such as SBOL Visual and SBGN. Protein Language
  consists of glyphs for representing important features (e.g., globular domains,
  recognition and localization sequences, sites of covalent modification, cleavage
  and catalysis), rules for composing these glyphs to represent complex architectures,
  and rules constraining the scaling and styling of diagrams. To support Protein Language
  we have implemented an extensible web-based software diagram tool, Protein Designer,
  that uses Protein Language in a “drag and drop” interface for visualization and
  computer-aided-design of engineered proteins, as well as conversion of annotated
  protein sequences to Protein Language diagrams and figure export. Protein Designer
  can be accessed at http://protlang.biocad.io/.
