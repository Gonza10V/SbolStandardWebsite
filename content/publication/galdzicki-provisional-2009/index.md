abstract: This BioBricks Foundation Request for Comments (BBF RFC) describes a semantic
  markup language for publishing and sharing information about BioBricks on the World
  Wide Web.  This BBF RFC includes the recommendation for the minimal information
  expected when  creating a Provisional BioBrick Language (PoBoL) description of BioBricks
  and for the implementation of the language using Web Ontology Language (OWL).
