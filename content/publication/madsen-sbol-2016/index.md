abstract: 'Recently, synthetic biologists have developed the Synthetic Biology Open
  Language (SBOL), a data exchange standard for descriptions of genetic parts, devices,
  modules, and systems. The goals of this standard are to allow scientists to exchange
  designs of biological parts and systems, to facilitate the storage of genetic designs
  in repositories, and to facilitate the description of genetic designs in publications.
  In order to achieve these goals, the development of an infrastructure to store,
  retrieve, and exchange SBOL data is necessary. To address this problem, we have
  developed the SBOL Stack, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) database specifically
  designed for the storage, integration, and publication of SBOL data. This database
  allows users to define a library of synthetic parts and designs as a service, to
  share SBOL data with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally.
  The database also allows external data sources to be integrated by mapping them
  to the SBOL data model. The SBOL Stack includes two Web interfaces: the SBOL Stack
  API and SynBioHub. While the former is designed for developers, the latter allows
  users to upload new SBOL biological designs, download SBOL documents, search by
  keyword, and visualize SBOL data. Since the SBOL Stack is based on semantic Web
  technology, the inherent distributed querying functionality of RDF databases can
  be used to allow different SBOL stack databases to be queried simultaneously, and
  therefore, data can be shared between different institutes, centers, or other users.'
