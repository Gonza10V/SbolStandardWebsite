abstract: VisBOL is a Web-based application that allows the rendering of genetic circuit
  designs, enabling synthetic biologists to visually convey designs in SBOL visual
  format. VisBOL designs can be exported to formats including PNG and SVG images to
  be embedded in Web pages, presentations and publications. The VisBOL tool enables
  the automated generation of visualizations from designs specified using the Synthetic
  Biology Open Language (SBOL) version 2.0, as well as a range of well-known bioinformatics
  formats including GenBank and Pigeoncad notation. VisBOL is provided both as a user
  accessible Web site and as an open-source (BSD) JavaScript library that can be used
  to embed diagrams within other content and software.
