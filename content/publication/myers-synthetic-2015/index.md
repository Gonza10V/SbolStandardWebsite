abstract: The design and construction of engineered organisms is an emerging new discipline
  called synthetic biology and holds considerable promise as a new technological platform.
  The design of biologically engineered systems is however nontrivial, requiring contributions
  from a wide array of disciplines. One particular issue that confronts synthetic
  biologists is the ability to unambiguously describe novel designs such that they
  can be reengineered by a third-party. For this reason, the synthetic biology open
  language (SBOL) was developed as a community wide standard for formally representing
  biological designs. A design created by one engineering team can be transmitted
  electronically to another who can then use this design to reproduce the experimental
  results. The development and the community of the SBOL standard started in 2008
  and has since grown in use with now over 80 participants, including international,
  academic, and industrial interests. SBOL has stimulated the development of repositories
  and software tools to help synthetic biologists in their design efforts. This chapter
  summarizes the latest developments and future of the SBOL standard and its supporting
  infrastructure.
