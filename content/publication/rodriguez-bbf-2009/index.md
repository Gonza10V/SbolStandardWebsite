abstract: Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOLv) is a graphical notation that
  supports   biological device development. It provides a formal notation for describing
  the physical   composition of basic parts into composite parts during the development
  of biological devices. It   is targeted for use by biological engineers in forward
  engineering projects. It encourages and   supports model-driven engineering.
