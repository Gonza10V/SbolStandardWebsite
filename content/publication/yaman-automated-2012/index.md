abstract: Raising the level of abstraction for synthetic biology design requires solving
  several challenging problems, including mapping abstract designs to DNA sequences.
  In this paper we present the first formalism and algorithms to address this problem.
  The key steps of this transformation are feature matching, signal matching, and
  part matching. Feature matching ensures that the mapping satisfies the regulatory
  relationships in the abstract design. Signal matching ensures that the expression
  levels of functional units are compatible. Finally, part matching finds a DNA part
  sequence that can implement the design. Our software tool MatchMaker implements
  these three steps.
