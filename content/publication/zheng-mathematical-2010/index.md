abstract: Mathematical modeling plays an important and often indispensable role in
  synthetic biology because it serves as a crucial link between the concept and realization
  of a biological circuit. We review mathematical modeling concepts and methodologies
  as relevant to synthetic biology, including assumptions that underlie a model, types
  of modeling frameworks (deterministic and stochastic), and the importance of parameter
  estimation and optimization in modeling. Additionally we expound mathematical techniques
  used to analyze a model such as sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis, which
  enable the identification of the conditions that cause a synthetic circuit to behave
  in a desired manner. We also discuss the role of modeling in phenotype analysis
  such as metabolic and transcription network analysis and point out some available
  modeling standards and software. Following this, we present three case studies—a
  metabolic oscillator, a synthetic counter, and a bottom-up gene regulatory network—which
  have incorporated mathematical modeling as a central component of synthetic circuit
  design.
