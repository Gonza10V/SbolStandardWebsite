# Transportation and Logistics

## Getting to Boston

People will generally want to fly into Boston&#8217;s Logan International Airport (BOS), though cheaper domestic flights may sometimes be available to Providence, RI,  or Manchester, NH.

Waltham is just beyond the range of easy public transit in Boston.  The best way to get to the recommended hotels from Logan Airport is likely by airport shuttle service: round trips can be booked for about $30 at <http://www.gobostonshuttle.com/>.  A taxi is likely to cost around $80.

## Hotels

Several hotels are close to the meeting location, and most provide shuttles that can take you to/from Raytheon. Recommended hotels are:
