                    The next SBOL Workshop will take place on <span><span>November<br /> 7</span></span>-8, 2012, at Boston University, and the theme<br /> will be &#8220;Growing SBOL Adoption&#8221;.</p> 
                    
                    <p>
                      There are seventeen computational tools which currently support<br /> SBOL, and DARPA has mandated SBOL support for the Living<br /> Foundries recipients. What is necessary to encourage continued<br /> adoption of SBOL? How do we further diversify the adoption of<br /> SBOL? We want to encourage adoption by a broader community,<br /> such as scientific journals, online repositories, DNA<br /> fabricators, and commercial software tool developers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      We&#8217;ll be sending out more details on the agenda shortly, but in<br /> the meantime we need to get a feel for how many people are<br /> attending so we reserve a large enough space for the workshop.<br /> Please go to the link below to let us know what your plans are.<br /> We do plan to offer remote connectivity for people who are<br /> unable to attend in person, so it would be good to know how<br /> many people would take advantage of that as well.
