The SBOL GitHub repository can be accessed here.

The SBOL community works actively on the SBOL data model and visual standard, participates in online discussions, and meets semi-annually.  We represent over 170+ members from 17 different countries, 42 institutions, and 28 different industries. Many of our members are also actively involved in other standards communities, like the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN).
