abstract: The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is an emerging synthetic biology
  data exchange standard, designed primarily for unambiguous and efficient machine-to-machine
  communication. However, manual editing of SBOL is generally difficult for nontrivial
  designs. Here, we describe ShortBOL, a lightweight SBOL scripting language that
  bridges the gap between manual editing, visual design tools, and direct programming.
  ShortBOL is a shorthand textual language developed to enable users to create SBOL
  designs quickly and easily, without requiring strong programming skills or visual
  design tools.
