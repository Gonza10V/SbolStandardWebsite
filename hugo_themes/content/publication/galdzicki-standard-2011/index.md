abstract: We have created the Knowledgebase of Standard Biological Parts (SBPkb) as
  a publically accessible Semantic Web resource for synthetic biology (sbolstandard.org).
  The SBPkb allows researchers to query and retrieve standard biological parts for
  research and use in synthetic biology. Its initial version includes all of the information
  about parts stored in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (partsregistry.org).
  SBPkb transforms this information so that it is computable, using our semantic framework
  for synthetic biology parts. This framework, known as SBOL-semantic, was built as
  part of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), a project of the Synthetic Biology
  Data Exchange Group. SBOL-semantic represents commonly used synthetic biology entities,
  and its purpose is to improve the distribution and exchange of descriptions of biological
  parts. In this paper, we describe the data, our methods for transformation to SBPkb,
  and finally, we demonstrate the value of our knowledgebase with a set of sample
  queries. We use RDF technology and SPARQL queries to retrieve candidate “promoter”
  parts that are known to be both negatively and positively regulated. This method
  provides new web based data access to perform searches for parts that are not currently
  possible.
