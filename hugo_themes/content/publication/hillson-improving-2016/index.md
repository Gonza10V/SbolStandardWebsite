abstract: Research is communicated more effectively and reproducibly when articles
  depict genetic designs consistently and fully disclose the complete sequences of
  all reported constructs. ACS Synthetic Biology is now providing authors with updated
  guidance and piloting a new tool and publication workflow that facilitate compliance
  with these recommended practices and standards for visual representation and data
  exchange.
