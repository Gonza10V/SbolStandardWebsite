abstract: A common method for publicly distributing design diagrams on the Web would
  enhance understanding of the mechanisms and intended function of synthetic DNA constructs.
  We aim to improve the usefulness of the depicted design to readers by establishing
  a systematic scheme for linking diagrams of synthetic biological mechanisms to reference
  information on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts [1]. Through the  use of
  standard diagrams based on SBOL-visual (BBF RFC 16) symbols, we hope to facilitate
  communication about synthetic DNA constructs between research groups. This standard
  applies the use of the established SBOLv symbols on the Web to clearly represent
  synthetic constructs. Linking these diagrams using http URLs to reference information
  at the Registry provides a method to retrieve contextual reference information about
  components of DNA constructs. Use of standardized diagrams in engineering promotes
  fast and accurate communication between researchers, which in turn promotes effective
  re-use of biological parts.
