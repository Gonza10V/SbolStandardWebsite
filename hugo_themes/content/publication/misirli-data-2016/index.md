abstract: One aim of synthetic biologists is to create novel and predictable biological
  systems from simpler modular parts. This approach is currently hampered by a lack
  of well-defined and characterized parts and devices. However, there is a wealth
  of existing biological information, which can be used to identify and characterize
  biological parts, and their design constraints in the literature and numerous biological
  databases. However, this information is spread among these databases in many different
  formats. New computational approaches are required to make this information available
  in an integrated format that is more amenable to data mining. A tried and tested
  approach to this problem is to map disparate data sources into a single data set,
  with common syntax and semantics, to produce a data warehouse or knowledge base.
  Ontologies have been used extensively in the life sciences, providing this common
  syntax and semantics as a model for a given biological domain, in a fashion that
  is amenable to computational analysis and reasoning. Here, we present an ontology
  for applications in synthetic biology design, SyBiOnt, which facilitates the modeling
  of information about biological parts and their relationships. SyBiOnt was used
  to create the SyBiOntKB knowledge base, incorporating and building upon existing
  life sciences ontologies and standards. The reasoning capabilities of ontologies
  were then applied to automate the mining of biological parts from this knowledge
  base. We propose that this approach will be useful to speed up synthetic biology
  design and ultimately help facilitate the automation of the biological engineering
  life cycle.
