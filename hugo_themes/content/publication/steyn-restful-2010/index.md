abstract: Constructing simulatable models for BioBricks by hand is a complex and time-consuming
  task. The time taken could be reduced by using Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools
  to aid in designing models, but these tools need to be augmented with domain-specific
  knowledge. Here we propose a standard for a RESTful (Richardson, 2007) API which
  facilitates the discovery and publication of models of functional biological units.
  This API is designed to produce parts models which can be automatically combined
  into complete, simulatable models of entire systems.
