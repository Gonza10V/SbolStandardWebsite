The SBOL editors are pleased to announce the official release of [version 2.0 of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)](http://sbolstandard.org/downloads/specification-data-model-2-0/ "Specification (Data Model 2.0)").

Major new capabilities of SBOL version 2.0 over the prior 1.x include:

  * Beyond DNA, designs can include RNA, proteins, and other components
  * Designs can associate function with structure and link to external models
  * Rich annotation of biological designs, for integration with non-SBOL design information

This specification is complemented by the [2.0 beta release of libSBOLj](http://sbolstandard.org/libsbol/), a library implementing the SBOL 2.0 specification in order to allow simple integration of the new SBOL capabilities into software tools.
