At long last, the SBOL Visual paper is now published in PLOS Biology!  SBOL Visual is a graphical standard for genetic engineering, consisting of symbols for DNA subsequences, regulatory elements, and DNA assembly feature.  You can access the paper at <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://journals.plos.org/<wbr />plosbiology/article?id=10.<wbr />1371/journal.pbio.1002310</a>.  Thanks to all the SBOL Developers who helped see this through to publication!
