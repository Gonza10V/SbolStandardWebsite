    <span class="s1">We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/SynBioDex/libSBOL/releases">libSBOL-2.1.1</a> which is now available for download.</span>

  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">libSBOL provides the C/C++ API for constructing, manipulating, and serializing synthetic biology designs in the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) data format. Version 2.1.1 of libSBOL provides support for the SBOL 2.1.0 data specification.  We are particularly proud of this library&#8217;s extensible, object-oriented API for custom RDF/XML data extensions, making it simple and easy to integrate SBOL data into custom workflows. </span>

  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">This release includes binary installers for Windows and Mac OSX, 32 and 64 bit. The Windows installer provides binaries  pre-built with Visual Studio 2015. Mac OSX binary distributions can be obtained through the package distribution service homebrew. Linux users are encouraged to build the libraries from source or try linuxbrew package service.</span>
