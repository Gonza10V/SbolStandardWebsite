The SBOL Developers community meets approximately every 6 months. The discussion at these workshops is often convivial, collegiate, and interesting. In May 2014 the SBOL Developers group elected to co-locate future SBOL workshops with similar workshops hosted by the [&#8220;Computational Modeling in Biology&#8221; Network (COMBINE)](http://co.mbine.org/). This creates an atmosphere where synthetic biologists and systems biologists can work toward a common goal of integrating biological knowledge through inter-operable and non-overlapping data standards. Our &#8220;COMBINE&#8221;d efforts empower exciting innovations like [modeling whole cells](https://sites.google.com/site/vwwholecellsummerschool/).

We welcome participants from industry to these discussions, as the SBOL standard exists to support commercial as well as scientific innovation in synthetic biology and biotechnology.
